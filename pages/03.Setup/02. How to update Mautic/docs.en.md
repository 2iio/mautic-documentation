There are two ways to update Mautic:

1. [Using the Command Line][command-line-update] (recommended)
2. Through the [user interface][user-interface-update]

If your instance is being used in production and has a large number of contacts - especially if using shared hosting - it is **strongly** recommended that you update at the command line.

>>>> Updating in the user interface requires a significant amount of resources, and can be error-prone if the server restricts resource allocation.  This can lead to failed updates and corrupted data.
